# ANALYSIS OF HOLISTIC URBANIZATION FACTORS AND CARBON EMISSIONS IN MALAYSIA : FROM STATISTICAL PERSPECTIVE
Rapid urbanization in Malaysia has become a major driver of economic growth, however, it has simultaneously contributed to rising carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions, placing increasing pressure on environmental sustainability. Although various urbanization factors have been identified as key contributors to carbon emissions, comprehensive quantitative empirical analysis examining the relationships among these factors remains limited, particularly within the context of national-level annual data. Accordingly, this study aims to assess the strength and direction of the relationships between selected urbanization factors, namely total road length, agricultural land area, gross domestic product (GDP), population, and total energy production with carbon emissions in Malaysia, as well as to compare the predictive performance of two models: Multiple Linear Regression and Random Forest. The analysis employs the Shapiro–Wilk normality test, Spearman correlation analysis, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multiple Linear Regression, and the Random Forest algorithm, with a Rolling-Origin (Expanding Window) technique applied for time-series validation. The PCA results indicate that two principal components, PC1 and PC2, successfully capture approximately 98.78% of the total variance in the urbanization factors. PC1 is interpreted as a Comprehensive Urbanization Dimension, encompassing economic growth, energy consumption, infrastructure development, and population expansion, while PC2 represents a Structural Urbanization Dimension, distinguishing patterns of land-use change and population intensity. When the PC1 and PC2 scores are incorporated into the predictive models, both approaches demonstrate the ability to explain variations in carbon emissions. However, the Multiple Linear Regression model achieves higher predictive accuracy, recording a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 4.26% compared to 6.18% for the Random Forest model. These findings suggest that traditional PCA-based statistical methods may offer superior predictive performance relative to machine learning approaches when applied to small-sample annual time-series data. Overall, this study contributes to the development of a data-driven analytical framework for understanding the relationship between urbanization and carbon emissions and provides empirical support for the formulation of low-carbon urban development policies, in line with Malaysia’s national development agenda and its commitment to reducing carbon emission intensity by 2030.
