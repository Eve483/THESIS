# ANALYSIS OF HOLISTIC URBANIZATION FACTORS AND CARBON EMISSIONS IN MALAYSIA : FROM STATISTICAL PERSPECTIVE
The rapid pace of urbanization in Malaysia has been a major driver of economic growth but, at the same time, has contributed to increasing carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions, exerting pressure on environmental sustainability. The main problem addressed in this study arises from the lack of comprehensive empirical analysis on the quantitative relationship between various urbanization factors such as total road length, agricultural land area, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), population, and total energy production with the country’s level of carbon emissions. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the strength and direction of the relationships among these factors while examining the performance of two predictive models which are Linear Regression and Random Forest (RF) in forecasting carbon emissions in Malaysia. The analytical methods employed include the Shapiro–Wilk Normality Test, Spearman Correlation, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multiple Linear Regression, and the RF algorithm as well as Rolling-Origin (Expanding Window) validation technique. The results indicate that two principal components (PC1 and PC2) explain more than 80 percent of the total variation, where PC1, identified as the Comprehensive Urbanization Dimension, is driven by population, total energy production, GDP, agricultural land area, and total road length, while PC2, identified as the Structural Urbanization Dimension, is influenced primarily by agricultural land and population. After fitting PC1 and PC2 into the Linear Regression and Random Forest models, both models successfully identified significant positive relationships between urbanization factors and CO₂ emissions. However, the Linear Regression model demonstrated higher predictive accuracy, with MAPE = 4.26% compared to 6.18% for the Random Forest model. This finding reveals that traditional statistical approaches can outperform machine learning methods when the dataset is well-suited. The study contributes to developing a data-driven analytical framework to support low-carbon urban development policies, aligned with Malaysia’s Twelfth Plan and its commitment under the Perjanjian Paris (2015) to reduce carbon emission intensity by 45 percent by 2030.
